"""The Codex pack for league_viktor's actions drawn whole at PPU 1.81 (assets/source/viktor/ACTIONS_PROMPT_PPU.md):
every frame of his actions - his attack, Q Siphon Power (skill), W Gravity Field (skill2), E Hextech Ray (skill2_e), R
Chaos Storm (ult), run, hit and death - a new drawing of the approved design (hd/design.png: Codex's viktor-A read on
~14.8-px squares, 49 x 76 - the user, 2026-11-05: 「凯隐本体 1.80 凯隐暗裔 1.79 凯隐影流 1.80 维克托 1.81 永恩2.20 泰坦1.80」) in the pose of
the OLD sheet's same frame, tools/art/pack_ryze_actions.py's way (pack_blitzcrank_actions.py's latest), one PR with the
rest of batch 5.

    python tools/art/pack_viktor_actions.py --out C:/t/viktor_actions

The weapon and hands go where the old frame has them (WEAPONS); the old frames' baked effects are not drawn. The run's
legs change over (RUN_LEGS: named frame by frame from the start - deferred to the pale figure, Codex's runs kept the
same legs in all 8 frames).

Not drawn: idle_base (the design, held still), idle and bp (tools/art/hero_reels.json cuts them from the actions). Old
frames that are another frame pixel for pixel are drawn once (SAME). Nothing is baked. Each template sheet
(templates/<tag>_<k>.png, 1536 x 1024) holds ONE or TWO frames: in each cell the old 1x frame scaled to his height (PPU
squares a pixel, SQ px a square), faded, as the pose to follow, standing on the ground line at the standing point, and a
bar as tall as he stands. refs/design_picture.png is Codex's own viktor-A, the picture the design was read from (its
fine detail). Then <out>.zip.

"""The Codex pack for league_fizz's actions drawn whole at PPU 1.81 (assets/source/fizz/ACTIONS_PROMPT_PPU.md): every
frame of his actions - his attack, the empowered W thrust (attack_w), Q Urchin Strike (skill), E Playful / Trickster
(skill2), R Chum the Waters (ult), run, hit and death - a new drawing of the approved design (hd/design.png: Codex's
fizz-A read on ~15-px squares, 95 x 58 - the user, 2026-11-09: 「泽丽2.1 佐伊2.64 米利欧2.21 其他都1.8」) in the pose of the OLD
sheet's same frame, tools/art/pack_ryze_actions.py's way (pack_blitzcrank_actions.py's latest), one PR with the rest of
batch 8.

    python tools/art/pack_fizz_actions.py --out C:/t/fizz_actions

The weapon and hands go where the old frame has them (WEAPONS); the old frames' baked effects are not drawn. The run's
legs change over (RUN_LEGS: named frame by frame from the start - deferred to the pale figure, Codex's runs kept the
same legs in all 8 frames).

Not drawn: idle_base (the design, held still), idle and bp (tools/art/hero_reels.json cuts them from the actions). Old
frames that are another frame pixel for pixel are drawn once (SAME). BAKED: the old skill carries Q's dash streak
(fizz_bake.json q_dash, laid under him): its native body cells are drawn (pack_akali_actions.py's way:
assets/source/native/fizz_cells.json, at 1x on their own pivots). Each template sheet (templates/<tag>_<k>.png, 1536 x
1024) holds ONE or TWO frames: in each cell the old 1x frame scaled to his height (PPU squares a pixel, SQ px a square),
faded, as the pose to follow, standing on the ground line at the standing point, and a bar as tall as he stands.
refs/design_picture.png is Codex's own fizz-A, the picture the design was read from (its fine detail). Then <out>.zip.

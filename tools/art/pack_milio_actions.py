"""The Codex pack for league_milio's actions drawn whole at PPU 2.21 (assets/source/milio/ACTIONS_PROMPT_PPU.md): every
frame of his actions - his attack, Q Ultra Mega Fire Kick (skill), E Warm Hugs with W Cozy Campfire (skill2), R Breath
of Life (ult), run, hit and death - a new drawing of the approved design (hd/design.png: Codex's milio-A read on
~11.8-px squares, 58 x 73 - the user, 2026-11-09: 「泽丽2.1 佐伊2.64 米利欧2.21 其他都1.8」) in the pose of the OLD sheet's same
frame, tools/art/pack_ryze_actions.py's way (pack_blitzcrank_actions.py's latest), one PR with the rest of batch 8.

    python tools/art/pack_milio_actions.py --out C:/t/milio_actions

The weapon and hands go where the old frame has them (WEAPONS); the old frames' baked effects are not drawn. The run's
legs change over (RUN_LEGS: named frame by frame from the start - deferred to the pale figure, Codex's runs kept the
same legs in all 8 frames). His old frames lack the backpack (the drawing adds it on every frame; BACK_PAD keeps room
for it behind him) and carry his old fire spirit behind his shoulder (not drawn: the rig floats the new spirit,
hd/design_spirit.png, in as a layer of its own).

Not drawn: idle_base (the design, held still), idle and bp (tools/art/hero_reels.json cuts them from the actions). Old
frames that are another frame pixel for pixel are drawn once (SAME). Nothing is baked. Each template sheet
(templates/<tag>_<k>.png, 1536 x 1024) holds ONE or TWO frames: in each cell the old 1x frame scaled to his height (PPU
squares a pixel, SQ px a square), faded, as the pose to follow, standing on the ground line at the standing point, and a
bar as tall as he stands. refs/design_picture.png is Codex's own milio-A, the picture the design was read from (its fine
detail). Then <out>.zip.

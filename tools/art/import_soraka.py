"""Import Soraka's effects (assets/source/soraka/PROMPTS.md, 10-18) as game sheets.

    python tools/art/import_soraka.py

The body comes from tools/art/import_native.py (with assets/source/native/soraka_retouch.json).
The nine effect strips came back from the Codex run as native pixel art: every game pixel one flat
8x8 block, frames in equal cells (32 px square; the bolt 32x16; the falling star and the Wish
pillar 32x64). They are read one pixel per block and anchored where the handoff says each frame is
drawn (codex/HANDOFF.md): the bolt on its crescent, hits on their centre, the ground effects on the
landing point or the ring's centre, the effects around a person on that person's feet. Everything
drawn around a person-sized space is enlarged 2x - the space is about 19 px tall in a 32 px cell,
a hero 34 - and so are the star's ring and the Equinox field, which then span about 60 px, the
30000 radius of league_soraka's Q and E. Views are drawn at the unit's pivot, 11 px above the feet
line (import_leesin.py and import_lux.py do the same), so feet and ground anchors go 11 px below it.
No palette or outline pass: the effects keep the delivery's colours.
Writes league/effects/league_soraka_fx (bolt, hit, rejuv, e_bind, w_heal),
league/effects/league_soraka_zone (q_star, e_field) and league/effects/league_soraka_r (cast, heal).

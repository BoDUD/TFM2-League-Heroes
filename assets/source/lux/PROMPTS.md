# 拉克丝：给 GPT 的生图提示词

一共 19 张：1 张造型图、8 张角色动作、10 张特效。生成的 PNG 放进一个文件夹（或 `lux` 分支的 `assets/source/lux/`），然后告诉 Claude。
Claude 负责切帧、缩到游戏尺寸（身高约 34 px）、统一调色板、补 1 px 黑描边、对齐脚底，再接到技能上（`tools/art/import_lux.py`，导入时再写）。

这一轮从一开始就按盖伦、艾希 Q 版重画总结的规矩来（[`../CHIBI_REDRAW.md`](../CHIBI_REDRAW.md)）：
附原版英雄对照图、姿势参考图本身就是大头比例、先单独出造型图并检查头和脸，再同一批生成全部动作。

## 技能方案（每张图用在哪里）

| 技能位 | 内容 | 用到的图 |
|---|---|---|
| 普攻 | 法杖射出光弹。被动「光芒四射」：技能命中后，下一次普攻引爆光芒，追加魔法伤害 | `lux_attack` · `lux_fx_bolt` · `lux_fx_hit` · `lux_fx_ignite` |
| 技能 1 | Q「光之束缚」：直线光球，穿过的敌人受到魔法伤害并被定身。合并 W「曲光屏障」：施放时给自己和身边的友方英雄套护盾 | `lux_skill` · `lux_fx_q_orb` · `lux_fx_q_bind` · `lux_fx_shield` |
| 技能 2 | E「透光奇点」：抛出光球，落地后形成减速光圈，1 秒后自动引爆 | `lux_skill2` · `lux_fx_e_orb` · `lux_fx_e_zone` |
| 大招 | R「终极闪光」：跃起悬空，蓄力后发射一道极长的激光 | `lux_ult` · `lux_fx_r_beam` |
| 被动标记 | Q、E、R 命中的敌人身上出现光芒标记 | `lux_fx_mark` |

## 生成顺序（重要）

1. **先只生成造型图 `lux_ref.png`**（第 1 条），附三张图：`pack_style_ref.png`、`tfm2_style_ref_mage.png`、`lux_model_chibi.png`。
2. 检查造型图：
   - 头约占身高 1/3（头顶到下巴 ÷ 头顶到脚底 = 32%–36%）；
   - 脸大、亮，两只蓝眼睛和眉毛清楚，刘海在眼睛上方；
   - 3/4 正面朝右，看得到脸和胸口；
   - 法杖完整，握在画面右侧那只手里；
   - 服装、配色和 `lux_model_chibi.png` 一致。

   **不对就重画这一张，不要带着错的造型图往下做。**
3. 8 张动作图**同一批**生成，每张附两张图：第一张 `lux_ref.png`（造型和大小），第二张是对应的姿势参考图（动作）。受击 `lux_hit.png` 在英雄联盟里没有对应动作，只附第一张。
4. 10 张特效图不附图，可以和动作图同时生成。
5. 以后要改造型，全部动作图用新造型图整批重画，不和旧批次混用。

## 附图（压缩包里有；Riot 模型渲染只在本地用，不提交到仓库）

| 文件 | 内容 | 用在 |
|---|---|---|
| `pack_style_ref.png` | 本包已通过的盖伦、艾希 Q 版造型图（仓库里的 `garen_ref_chibi.png` + `ashe_ref_chibi.png`） | 造型图 |
| `tfm2_style_ref_mage.png` | 团战经理 2 原版的 8 个法系英雄（白魔导士、牧师、附魔师、德鲁伊、火法师、幻术师、暗法师、结界师），上排待机、下排攻击，放大 8 倍 | 造型图 |
| `lux_model_chibi.png` | 英雄联盟游戏内模型的正面、侧面、背面，已经是大头比例 | 造型图 |
| `lux_pose_*.png` | 英雄联盟原版动作，大头比例，每帧对应原版的一个时间点 | 各自的动作图 |

## 所有角色图的规则

- 每张图是**一行**，N 个一样大的正方形格子，每格一帧；格子之间不要留缝、边框、文字或编号。
- **尺寸：每格 256×256**，一行 N 格就是 N×256 宽、256 高。如果输出比例受限，在这一行的上下补透明空白，**不要裁切或压扁角色**。
- **背景透明**。做不到透明时：角色图用纯品红 `#FF00FF`。
- 同一张图里每一帧的角色一样大；脚底在每一格的同一高度（88%）。角色、整根法杖都在自己的格子里，不碰到相邻格子。
- **比例**：头约占身高的 1/3，脸大而清楚；每一帧的头一样大。
- 3/4 正面朝右：看得到脸和胸口，不画背影。
- 拉克丝的移动是**跑步**（有双脚离地的帧），0.8 秒一个循环。
- 法杖始终在同一只手里（待机时是画面右侧那只手）；只有大招里法杖离手、悬浮在她身前，落地时再接回。
- 角色图只画角色本身和法杖上的光。飞出去的光弹、光球、激光都是单独的特效图，不要画进角色图。
- 如果模型不肯画带名字的角色，把提示词里的 "Lux" / "League of Legends" 删掉，只保留外观描述。

## 所有特效图的规则

- 没有黑描边；颜色用拉克丝的光系配色：白色核心 → 淡金 → 金黄，边缘带一点棱彩色（淡青、粉、淡紫）。
- 飞行道具一律**朝右**画，游戏会按飞行方向旋转；命中、标记类特效居中画，要空出人的位置的在提示词里写明。
- 背景透明（做不到时用纯黑 `#000000`）。

## 角色（9 张）

### 1. `lux_ref.png`：造型图，1 帧（附 `pack_style_ref.png`、`tfm2_style_ref_mage.png`、`lux_model_chibi.png`）

```text
Three attached images. FIRST: two approved heroes of this game pack (Garen and Ashe) - match their pixel-art style, 1-pixel outline, cel shading, level of detail, PROPORTIONS and size exactly, but do not copy their costumes; Lux is a petite young woman, about as tall as Ashe without the tip of Ashe's hood. SECOND: official heroes of the game Teamfight Manager 2 (mages and priests with staffs), top row idle, bottom row attacking - copy their proportions, the way their faces are drawn, and how a long staff is held and thrust at this size. THIRD: Lux's in-game model from League of Legends, front, side and back, already with the big head - use it for her hair, costume, colors and the shape of her wand.
Lux from League of Legends (default skin) as a 2D pixel art game sprite: a petite young Demacian mage girl. Thick honey-blonde hair ending just above her shoulders, big side-swept bangs, a dark brown hairband across the top of her head; big blue eyes; fair skin. A royal-blue high-collared long-sleeved bodysuit and royal-blue leggings; a gunmetal-silver breastplate with gold trim bands and two small red gems near the collar; small puffy white shoulder caps edged in gold; gunmetal forearm guards with gold rims; white gloves; a gold belt with a gold buckle; a short flared white skirt edged in gold; dark gunmetal armored knee-high boots with gold trim and small heels. Her signature weapon: a long slender wand-staff almost as tall as she is - a dark bronze shaft wrapped in a gold spiral ribbon, with ornate open golden filigree finials at both ends; the finial near her hand holds a small white-gold glow. Draw the wand clearly readable.
PROPORTIONS (most important), exactly like the heroes in the FIRST and SECOND images: the head is about ONE THIRD of her total height (from the top of the hair to the soles) - big and round; the FACE is large, lit and fully visible: the bangs sweep to the side ABOVE her eyes, two big blue eyes each with a dark outline and a 1-pixel white highlight, thin eyebrows, a small mouth - drawn bold and simple so it stays readable when the sprite is shrunk to 34 pixels tall; short legs, about one third of her height; a small, slim torso; the wand keeps its full length.
Style: pixel art sprite for Teamfight Manager 2, exactly like the FIRST image: chunky square pixels, hard edges, a 1-pixel black outline around the whole character, flat cel shading with 3-4 tones per color, no anti-aliasing, no gradients, no glow except the small light in the wand's finial, about 32-40 colors. 3/4 FRONT view facing right: we see her face, her chest and the front of her body. Never show her back.
Pose: the idle stance of the THIRD image's front view: feet apart, torso toward the viewer, head turned slightly to the right. She holds the wand in the hand on the RIGHT side of the image, near its upper end at hip height; the long shaft slants down and back across the front of her legs so its lower finial is near the ground to the LEFT of her feet. The other hand rests at her waist.
Layout: one single square image, 1024x1024, the character centered, feet on an invisible ground line at 88% of the image height, the character about 60% of the image height. Transparent background (if not possible: solid #FF00FF magenta). No text, no border, no shadow.
Before finishing, check: the head (hair top to chin) is 32-36% of the full height (hair top to soles); both eyes and eyebrows are clearly visible; the whole wand is inside the image.
```

8 张动作图的提示词都以同一段外观、比例、画风开头，可以整段复制。

### 2. `lux_idle.png`：待机，6 帧循环（附 `lux_ref.png` + `lux_pose_idle.png`）

```text
Same character as the FIRST attached image (Lux, League of Legends) - copy her exact design, colors, PROPORTIONS and size: a chibi Demacian mage girl with a BIG head (one third of her height) and a large, clearly visible face with big blue eyes (the bangs stay above the eyes), honey-blonde hair with a dark brown hairband, royal-blue bodysuit and leggings, gunmetal breastplate with gold trim, white gold-edged shoulder caps, short white skirt with gold trim, white gloves, dark gunmetal knee boots with gold trim, and a long slender wand-staff with a gold spiral and ornate golden finials.
Style: pixel art sprite like Teamfight Manager 2, exactly like the first image: chunky square pixels, hard edges, 1-pixel black outline, flat cel shading 3-4 tones, no anti-aliasing, no gradients, about 32-40 colors. 3/4 FRONT view facing right: we see her face and chest. Never show her back. The head stays the same big size in every frame and the face is never hidden.
Pose reference: the SECOND attached image is a 3D render of Lux's real in-game idle from League of Legends, already with the big head, seen from the front, 6 frames left to right. Copy each frame's pose exactly - stance, arms and where the wand points. Take only the poses from it: draw the character like the first image, in the same pixel-art style, not like the render (ignore its colors, lighting and 3D look).
Animation: IDLE, 6 frames, seamless loop, as in the pose reference: she stands relaxed but ready, feet apart, torso toward the viewer, head turned slightly right. The wand is held near its upper end at her hip in the hand on the right side of the image, the long shaft slanting down and back so its lower finial rests near the ground to the left of her feet. Only subtle breathing: shoulders and chest rise and fall 1 pixel, the hair sways slightly. Feet stay planted. Do not raise or swing the wand.
Layout: one horizontal row of 6 equal square cells, image size 1536x256, no gaps, no borders, no labels. The character is exactly as big as in the first image: about 60% of the cell height; feet on an invisible ground line at 88% of the cell height; body horizontally centered; the whole wand stays inside its own cell. If the output aspect ratio is restricted, add empty transparent space above and below the row instead of cropping or squeezing the sprites. Transparent background (if not possible: solid #FF00FF magenta).

Take only the poses from it: draw the character like the first image, in the same pixel-art style, not like the render (ignore its colors, lighting and 3D look).
Animation: RUN to the right, 8 frames, seamless loop, as in the pose reference. This is a RUN, not a walk: a light, bouncy, girlish stride, torso leaning forward a little, head up, looking ahead; in frames 1, 4, 5 and 8 BOTH feet are off the ground. The wand stays in the same hand as in the first image and swings with that arm: in frames 1-3 it trails low behind her, in frames 4-8 it swings forward and is held upright at her side, exactly like the reference. The hair bounces. The short legs keep the same length and shape in every frame; the body bobs up and down 2-3 pixels.
Layout: one horizontal row of 8 equal square cells, image size 2048x256, no gaps, no borders, no labels. The character is exactly as big as in the first image: when upright about 60% of the cell height; the ground line at 88% of the cell height in every cell (the feet leave it in the airborne frames); body horizontally centered; the whole wand stays inside its own cell. If the output aspect ratio is restricted, add empty transparent space above and below the row instead of cropping or squeezing the sprites.

## 技能特效（10 张）

10 张特效的提示词都以同一段画风和配色开头。

### 10. `lux_fx_bolt.png`：普攻光弹（飞行），4 帧循环

```text
Pixel art game VFX sprite sheet for a small tactics game: chunky square pixels, hard edges, no anti-aliasing, no outline, radiant light-magic color ramp (#FFFFFF, #FFF6D5, #FFE680, #FFC933, #E89B1A) with a few tiny prismatic glints (#A8F0FF, #FFB8E8).

Effect: LUCENT SINGULARITY field and detonation, 8 frames, seen from the same slightly top-down game camera. Frames 1-4 (a seamless loop): a wide circle of soft golden light lies flat on the ground - a slightly flattened circle about 1.3 times wider than tall that fills 90% of the cell width - with a bright thin rim and faint star-shaped light lines inside; the singularity orb (a glowing white-gold sphere with a four-pointed star in its core) hovers just above the center of the circle and pulses; a few sparkles rise. Frame 5: DETONATION - the orb bursts in a blinding white star flash; frame 6: a big starburst explosion of white-gold light filling the whole circle, rays shooting out; frame 7: the explosion fades into a ring of sparkles along the rim; frame 8: the last sparkles fade.
Layout: one horizontal row of 8 equal square cells, image size 2048x256; the center of the circle at the center of every cell, no gaps, no borders, no labels. Transparent background (if not possible: pure black #000000).

### 17. `lux_fx_r_beam.png`：R 终极闪光激光，6 帧（竖排）

游戏里这张图画在大招的长条判定范围上（长 240、宽 16），激光很长，所以 6 帧**上下排成一列**，每帧是一条横向的长条。

Effect: FINAL SPARK, a giant laser, 6 frames stacked in ONE COLUMN, frame 1 at the top. Every frame is a very wide horizontal strip (12 times wider than tall). The laser starts near the LEFT end of the strip (where the caster's floating wand is) and runs perfectly straight and horizontal all the way to the RIGHT edge, along the middle of the strip. 1 targeting: a thin, faint white-gold line along the whole length, a small glowing spark at the left end; 2 charging: the line a little brighter, a ball of white light gathering at the left end with sparkles pulled into it; 3 ignition: a blinding white flash at the left end and the beam bursting forward, already reaching the right edge; 4 FULL BEAM: a huge thick laser along the whole strip - a pure white core, a golden layer around it and prismatic (pale cyan, pink, lavender) outer fringes, about 70% of the strip height, with crackling sparkles along its edges; 5 full beam again, its edges rippling differently; 6 fading: the beam shrinks into a narrow flickering line and breaks into sparkles.
Layout: ONE COLUMN of 6 equal rows, each row one frame, image size 2048x1024 (each row about 2048x170); the beam centered vertically in its row and starting at the same place near the left end of every row; no gaps, no borders, no labels. Transparent background (if not possible: pure black #000000).

## 姿势参考图：英雄联盟原版动作和时间点

客户端里拉克丝的动作：待机 `lux_idle1`（1.07 秒一个呼吸循环）；移动只有 `lux_run`（0.8 秒一步循环，一个循环里约一半时间双脚离地，是跑不是走，脚底滑动约 210 单位/秒）；普攻 `lux_attack1`（约 233 ms 向前平刺出手）；Q `lux_spell1`（约 233 ms 出手）；W `lux_spell2`（没用到：W 合并进 Q）；E `lux_spell3`（约 267 ms 甩出光球）；R `lux_spell4`（0–130 ms 下蹲，130–800 ms 跃起悬空、法杖悬在身前约腰的高度并抖动蓄力，约 870 ms 发射时被后坐力推高，1000–1600 ms 空中蜷身，1800 ms 落地）；死亡 `lux_death`（被击飞，约 530 ms 仰面落地，最后 0.3 秒沉入地下，不用）。

拉克丝的动作大多是旧格式 `r3d2anmd` v3（R 是 v4），`pose_ref.py` 这一轮加上了这两种格式。她的胸口朝向自己的右侧，所以和盖伦一样加 `--mirror`（从另一侧渲染再翻转），所有动作同一侧，法杖不会换手。

`A>B:0.5` 表示两个动作各一半的混合姿势，英雄联盟切换动作时就是这样过渡的，用来让每个动作从待机开始、回到待机结束。

| 参考图 | 帧（动作@毫秒） |

```

死亡用较低的俯角（`--pitch 12`）：她被击飞时向后（离镜头远）移动约 160 单位，俯角 25 度会让躺在地上的身体看起来浮在地面上方。

三视图 `lux_model_chibi.png`：待机第 0 帧（`lux_idle1@0`，`--mirror --head 2.0 --legs 0.8 --hq`），`--yaw 40`、`100`、`200` 各渲染一张横向拼接，都用 `--pitch 10 --size 800 --width 0.75 --fit 0.8 --ground 0.92`。

`tfm2_style_ref_mage.png`：原版 white_mage、priest、enchanter、druid、pyromancer、illusionist、dark_mage、barrier_magician 的待机第 1 帧和攻击中间帧，脚底对齐，放大 8 倍（从游戏的 `bundle.game_data` 读取）。`pack_style_ref.png`：`garen/garen_ref_chibi.png` 和 `ashe/ashe_ref_chibi.png` 左右拼接。

## 结果（2026-09-26 导入）

- 19 张图一轮生成完成（交接说明和清单在 `HANDOFF.md`、`manifest.json`）。Codex 重画过两次：造型图第一版法杖歪了，重画后才批量生成动作；E 光圈第一版太扁。造型图的头约占身高 1/3，缩到 34 px 后眼睛看得清，头像截取点 (1, −33)。
- 每张动作图按头的大小缩放：待机第 1 帧的头在各帧上按不同比例做相关匹配，同一张图里可靠的匹配（相关系数 > 0.85）相差不到 0.03。站立身高（源像素）：待机 409、跑步 336、普攻 361、Q 273、E 218、R 281、受击 772、死亡 281。
- 头部轨迹按大头骨骼计算（`pose_ref.py --track 34`，和参考图同一镜头）。普攻、Q、E 的前冲保留原版的 70%，死亡的击飞保留 65%（原版被击飞约 41 px）。
- R 的法杖离手后越过了等宽格子的边界，按连通块切帧：含深蓝紧身衣的块是身体，其他块归给左边最近的身体。GPT 把悬浮的法杖画在膝盖高度，离地约 14 px，正好落在画在单位中心高度（11.5 px）的激光里，不用再调整悬空高度。
- 原地播放的特效（命中、标记、引爆、护盾、定身光环、E 光圈）按格子中心对齐：GPT 把每帧画在等宽格子正中，偏差不超过 8 px。
- 激光竖排 6 帧，按判定长度 240 px 缩放，从拉克丝身前 6 px 开始，预警 467 ms 后发射，和伤害判定同一 tick。

## 进游戏后的修正（2026-09-26）

用户反馈拉克丝的下半身有时像变了形。查下来是跑步第 4、5、7、8 帧：英雄联盟的 `lux_run` 后半段把法杖竖在身后，杖尾垂到后脚边。游戏尺寸下，金、白、肤色的杖尾和后腿之间没有描边隔开，读起来像一只金色的脚。四帧里这团像素改成和其他帧一样的深蓝腿、深色靴子，杖尾算作被腿挡住。共 42 个像素，记在 [`../native/lux_retouch.json`](../native/lux_retouch.json)，`import_native.py` 导入时套用。其他动作的腿都是深蓝加金色护膝、靴边，逐帧一致，没有改。（Codex 第二版重画后这处修改去掉了；2026-10-05 起 `lux_retouch.json` 由 `tools/art/lux_retouch.py` 生成，内容是补全手下面的半截法杖、统一两只眼睛，见 README。）
